API Reference
=============

Currently, the project is in early development. As modules and classes
are added to the codebase, their documentation will automatically appear here.

Modules
-------

When Python modules are added to the regenbogen package, they will be
documented here using Sphinx's autodoc functionality.

   API documentation will be generated automatically as the project develops.
