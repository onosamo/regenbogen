Quick Start
===========

Welcome to 🌈 regenbogen 🌈! This guide will help you get started with the framework.

Basic Usage
-----------

As the project is currently in early development, detailed usage examples
will be added as the API stabilizes.

Example Pipeline
----------------

Here's what a typical 🌈 regenbogen 🌈 pipeline might look like:

.. code-block:: python

   # Example code - this will be updated as the API develops
   from regenbogen import Pipeline
   
   # Create a new pipeline
   pipeline = Pipeline()
   
   # Add components
   # pipeline.add_component(...)
   
   # Process data
   # result = pipeline.process(input_data)

Stay tuned for more detailed examples and tutorials as the project develops!
